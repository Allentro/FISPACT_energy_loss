Description: # FISPACT-II Energy Loss 
        ## Introduction
        FISPACT-II is a point source transmutation and nuclear reaction code. Taking in cross-section data for a range of projectiles including neutrons, protons, deuterons, helium-3 and alpha.
        In a charged particle irradiation the projectile will lose energy through the target. This must be accounted for using stopping power $\frac{dE}{dx}$ calculations. 
        
        This project splits the calculation into a number of discrete components, one for each energy bin within the group structure. For charged particles the CCFE-162 group structure is used, while for neutrons the CCFE-709 group structure is used. 
        The two group structures are whoen together below:

        The energy steps for the CCFE-162 group structure are: 
        
           - E>10MeV:        1MeV steps 
           - 4MeV<E<10MeV:   0.2MeV steps 
           - 1MeV<E<4MeV:    125keV steps
           - 300keV<E<1MeV:  25KeV steps
           - 100keV<E<300keV:20keV steps
           - 10keV<E<100keV: 5keV steps
           
        The calculation takes into account the target thickness, breaking the target into discrete runs for each energy bin. Input files are sutomatically produced and FISPACT-II is run as a subprocess. Once the runs are complete, the individual runs are summed and parsed into a csv file containing the activity of each product over the irradiation time and cooling time.
